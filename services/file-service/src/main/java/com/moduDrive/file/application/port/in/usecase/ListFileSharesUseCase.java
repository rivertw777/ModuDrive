     * The file carries the owner and the link/scope state; OWNER is never a {@code shares} row.
     * {@code memberSummaries} is keyed by {@link FileShare#getSharedWithUserId()} so the web
     * mapper can enrich each share's display info without a lookup per row (see #156) — it covers
     * both {@code shares} and {@code inheritedShares}.
     * <p>
     * A directory share is inherited by everything under it, so this file's effective access is
     * its own grants plus whatever a directory above it grants:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code inheritedShares} — grants on an ancestor directory, each tagged with the
     *       directory they come from — a claimed member's grant or a still-unclaimed guest invite
     *       alike (issue #313: the guest case used to be silently dropped here, even though it
     *       already lets that guest into this file through PublicFileResolver). One row per
     *       (ancestor, grantee) pair, never collapsed — includes a grantee who also has a row in
     *       {@code shares} directly (see ListFileSharesService for why: a full revoke needs every
     *       one of those rows visible). FileAccessGuard.resolveRole ignores these entirely once a
     *       direct grant exists, but this view still needs to show them for the owner to actually
     *       revoke them.</li>
     *   <li>{@code inheritedLinkSources} — ancestor directories currently in LINK scope, i.e.
     *       "anyone with the link" reaches this file through them. Restricting this file means
     *       turning their link off (there is no per-item inheritance break).</li>
     * </ul>
